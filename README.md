**Benefits**

Building this payment form component helped to deepen my understanding of the Strategy design pattern and its practical application within React. By implementing different payment methods as separate strategies, I was able to enhance my skills in managing complexity and making components more modular and reusable.

**Features**

The payment form component allows users to input their payment details and select from different payment methods using a button, which dynamically changes certain aspects of the UI based on the selected strategy. The component incorporates basic input validation for each field, although it serves as a simplified example and may not cover all possible validation scenarios.
